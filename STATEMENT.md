## Problem Statement:
Air pollution is a major environmental and health concern worldwide. People often lack easy access to real-time air quality information for their location.
Most available air-quality apps are either complex, require installation, or hide pollutant-level details.

The problem:
Users need a simple, lightweight tool that provides instant real-time air quality data along with pollutant breakdown and meaningful health interpretation, without requiring advanced technical knowledge.

## Scope of the Project:
The scope of AeroTrack includes:

 What the project covers:
Fetching real-time AQI from OpenWeatherMap API

Retrieving pollutant concentration levels (CO, NO₂, O₃, SO₂, PM2.5, PM10, NH₃)

Converting place name to geographic coordinates

Displaying a clear, structured air quality report

Providing interpretation of AQI in simple language

Handling invalid inputs and API errors

## Target Users:
This project mainly targets:

~ General Users
Individuals who want to quickly check air quality of their city

People with respiratory conditions needing AQI awareness

~ Students & Learners
Beginners learning Python, APIs, and HTTP requests

Students doing environmental science or AI/ML projects

~ Developers
Programmers who want a simple example of API integration

Hobbyists building automation or environmental monitoring tools

 ~Researchers / Analysts
Those needing quick pollutant reference data during studies

## High-Level Features:
These are the main high-level features of the AeroTrack project:

1. Real-Time Air Quality Index Retrieval
Gets the AQI of any city using the OpenWeatherMap Air Pollution API.

2. Geolocation via Place Name
Converts user-entered place name into latitude & longitude coordinates.

3. Pollutant Breakdown
Shows concentration levels of:

CO

NO₂

O₃

SO₂

PM2.5

PM10

NH₃

4. AQI Interpretation Engine
Converts numerical AQI (1–5) into readable categories such as:

Good

Fair

Moderate

Poor

Very Poor

5. User-Friendly Output
Displays a clean, readable, and structured console report.

6. Input Validation & Error Messages
Detects:

Invalid place names

Missing API data

Connection failures
